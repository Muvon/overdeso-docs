# Overdeso

## What is Overdeso?

****[**Overdeso**](https://overdeso.com) is your final endpoint to build apps on top of **DeSo** ([https://deso.org](https://deso.org)).&#x20;

We crawl and index blockchain following its original consensus and extend it with social addons (full social profile, polls, blogging, subscriptions and more) that are written to blockchain using extra data and our own consensus rules!

We scale it for you and offer simple API to use. You just open your favourite code editor and start coding with ready to use API and no requirements to run own node and maintain large data.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Disclaimer: we are in early beta test mode and API methods can be changed. All data can be modified and fixed. Please use on your own risk. We will publish once we are production ready.&#x20;
