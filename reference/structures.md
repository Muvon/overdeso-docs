# Structures

There are 2 types of structures: item and list.

API methods that returns list always return it in the way with next fields included: **count** and **list**. Count is for how many items total for request and list contains limited items that you requested by passing parameters **offset** and **limit** in your request. By default **limit** is limited to be in range of **\[5, 100]**. If you pass limit outside of allowed it will be set to minimum.

{% hint style="info" %}
All values in **DESO** and **Creator Coins** are in **NANOS**. That means to get real human readable value you need to divide the number on **2 ^ 9**. For example, **1 DESO = 1,000,000,000 NANOS.**
{% endhint %}

Next you can find description of all available structures in responses with field details in it.
